We are using page object model for writing scripts.
camelCase is used for function and variable names,only nouns are used as variable names,Variable names clearly describe what is stored in them. 
Descriptive names are used for functions that reflect what they do and function names start with a verb


Running Tests:

           - To run the test, first, we need to open the repo folder in VS code and select the tests folder which contains the scripts.
            Open a new terminal and run the command npm run wdio.


If all the tests are working and the scripts are written correctly, the scripts should pass all the tests.
